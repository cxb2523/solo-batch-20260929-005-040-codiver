##  The Philosophy

Software is inherently human. Behind every line of code, every architectural decision, and every sprint metric lies human effort and engineering intent. The **CoDiver: Code Sniffer & Project Analyzer** was built on the premise that technical debt shouldn't be an abstract concept - it should be deeply visible, understandable, and actionable.

This platform bridges the gap between raw codebase complexity and human understanding. By unifying Python parsing, Java static analysis, and Agile process tracking into a single frictionless dashboard, the suite abstracts away the borders between languages and focuses purely on **the code**.

---

##  Architecture Overview

The platform operates on a **Zero-Coupling, Event-Reactive Architecture**. The frontend strictly delegates analysis to isolated backend engines, which parse raw files into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) on the fly.

##  Request Lifecycle & Data Flow

Data flows deterministically from the browser, through the AST generators, into Pandas dataframes, and back out to Plotly visuals. The UI remains fully stateless until explicitly commanded to execute an analysis.

##  Internal Module Structure

The repository enforces a strict separation between UI logic and calculation algorithms to guarantee high cohesion and maintainability at scale.

##  Build & Deployment Pipeline

Because this application leverages a robust Python backend for intensive AST processing, it is deployed natively via containerized Python runtimes (and cannot be served statically via standard GitHub Pages).

###  Live Demo
The platform is currently live and operational on Streamlit Community Cloud.

**Access the live suite here:** [codiver.streamlit.app](https://codiver.streamlit.app/)

###  Self-Hosting & Deployment
Because this application leverages a robust Python backend for intensive AST processing, it is deployed natively via containerized Python runtimes.

#### Deployment via Streamlit Cloud (Recommended)
1. **Fork** this repository.
2. Navigate to [Streamlit Share](https://share.streamlit.io/).
3. Connect your fork and point the main file path to `app.py`.
4. The cloud environment will automatically parse `requirements.txt` and deploy your instance.

### Local Development Workflow
To initialize the suite in a local development environment:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CoDiver.git
cd CoDiver

# 2. Install AST parsers and UI dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Boot the reactive frontend server
streamlit run app.py
```

##  Development & Contribution

New ideas, architectural optimizations, and structural improvements are warmly welcomed. The system is designed to be highly extensible - adding support for a new language parser simply requires introducing a new module within `src/` and wiring it to the Universal Control Center in `app.py`.

*When modifying the codebase, please ensure that UI concerns remain strictly separated from backend AST calculation logic.*
